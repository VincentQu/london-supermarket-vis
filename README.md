London-Supermarkets
===================

This little visualisation project is based on location data on UK supermarkets, recently published by [geolytix](http://geolytix.co.uk/blog/?p=238). For reasons of curiosity I limited the data to London. The dataset lists each branch (and the exact location) of major UK retailers:
* Tesco
* Sainsbury's
* Marks and Spencer
* Waitrose
* Lidl
* Morrisons
* Asda
* Budgens
* Aldi
* Whole Foods

(ordered by the number of branches in London)
