London-Supermarkets
===================

![Housing prices and Waitrose locations](Maps/Waitrose_Housing.png)

This little visualisation project is based on location data on UK supermarkets, recently published by [geolytix](http://geolytix.co.uk/blog/?p=238). For reasons of curiosity I limited the data to London. I find a nice visual correlation of Waitrose location and high housing prices. 

The dataset lists each branch (and the exact location) of major UK retailers:
* Tesco
* Sainsbury's
* Marks and Spencer
* Waitrose
* Lidl
* Morrisons
* Asda
* Budgens
* Aldi
* Whole Foods

(ordered by the number of branches in London)
